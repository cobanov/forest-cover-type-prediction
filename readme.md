### Kaggle

For this competition, you will be predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a the data from the Forest Cover Type Prediction. This dataset is (a) much larger, and (b) may or may not have the same relationship to the target as the original data.

Please refer to this data page for a detailed explanation of the features.

### Files

- **train.csv**: the training data with the target **Cover_Type** column
- **test.csv** - the test set; you will be predicting the **Cover_Type** for each row in this file (the target integer class)
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
